# APPN – Aerial Data QC Protocols


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The full QC pipeline is still under active development.** It is being
> developed and tested as part of the early-season APEx flights, and parts
> of this protocol may change as that work progresses.

> [!NOTE]
> This document describes procedures for measuring the uncertainty of drone
> flights. Initially this document focuses on the
> hyperspectral drones, but the procedure will expand in the future.
> It will also form the basis of a standard QC procedure for future flights.

> [!NOTE]
> The QC procedures in this document are tightly coupled to the APPN flight
> designs — the panels, ground control points, and reflectance targets that
> the QC steps rely on are deployed *during* the flight itself. Before
> performing any QC, make sure you understand which targets were placed in
> the field by reading the relevant flight protocol:
>
> - [Standard Flight](../../FlightDesign/StandardFlight/Standard_Flight.md)
>   — routine APPN data-collection flight; defines the baseline panel and
>   GCP layout used for ELM and positional QC.
> - [Validation Flight](../../FlightDesign/ValidationFlight/Validation_Flight.md)
>   — extended flight that adds additional validation panels, GCPs, and
>   (in future) LiDAR calibration targets used by the spectral, positional,
>   and LiDAR QC sections below.

## General QC Conventions

These file-format, naming, and storage rules apply to every QC process
(positional, spectral, LiDAR) described later in this document.

### File Format — GeoJSON vs Shapefile

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **GeoJSON (`.geojson`) is the preferred format** for all QC vector data,
> though shapefiles (`.shp`) are also supported by the QA and plot 
> extraction code  <https://github.com/ArdenB/APPN_GenricFileStorage>.
>
> GeoJSON is preferred because:
>
> - It is a **single self-contained file**, rather than the 4–6 sidecar files
>   (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, `.prj`, `.cpg`, …) required by the shapefile
>   format. This makes it easier to copy, share, and store without losing
>   pieces.
> - It is **plain-text JSON**, so it is human-readable, diff-friendly, and
>   works cleanly with Git version control.
> - It is an **open, web-native standard** (RFC 7946) supported by virtually
>   all modern GIS tools, web mappers, and Python/R libraries.
> - CRS handling is explicit: the default GeoJSON specification (RFC 7946)
>   only supports WGS84 (EPSG:4326), but all major GIS software (QGIS,
>   ArcGIS, GDAL, geopandas, etc.) allow you to specify and read a different
>   CRS when writing/reading the file. For APPN QC work we **keep the file
>   in the same projected CRS as the source orthomosaic** (e.g. GDA2020 /
>   MGA zone XX) rather than reprojecting to WGS84.
> - It has **no field-name length limit** (shapefile DBF caps at 10
>   characters) and no 2 GB file-size cap.
>
> If you already have shapefiles, you do **not** need to re-create them —
> the QA pipeline will read either format. New files should be saved as
> `.geojson`.

### Naming Conventions

| Name                                    | Overview                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `QC_ELM_Panels.geojson`                 | Polygons of the reflectance panels used in the ELM during GRYFN Processing.                                               |
| `QC_VAL_Grfyn_Panels.geojson`           | When a second set of GRYFN panels is placed in the field. Replace *ELM* with *VAL* for validation.                        |
| `QC_VAL_{PanelName}_Panels.geojson`     | Any future validation panels or tests of other panels. Replace `{PanelName}` with the name or unique identifier.          |
| `QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson`     | **Reference** GCP locations measured independently in the field (e.g. Aeropoint, Trimble RTK). Points-only file; one point per GCP, with an `ID` matching the field log.                                  |
| `QC_GCP_points.geojson`        | **Observed** GCP locations as digitised from the drone orthomosaic in QGIS. Points-only file; `GCP_name` must match the corresponding `ID` in `QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson` so the two can be paired for residual reporting. |
| `QC_LIDAR_{TargetName}_Surface.geojson` | Name for any future LiDAR calibration surfaces.                                                                           |

> [!TIP]
> Any additional information (e.g. date) can be added to the end of the file
> name with an underscore — e.g. `QC_ELM_Panels_20260302.geojson`. This
> table will be updated if we source panels other than GRYFN. Shapefile
> equivalents (e.g. `QC_ELM_Panels.shp`) are also accepted by the QA code.

### File Storage

Any files created in the quality control steps are to be stored in a newly
created `QC_data` folder inside `T1_proc`, following the
[APPN folder structure](https://github.com/ArdenB/APPN_GenricFileStorage/wiki/Folder-Structure).

Formal path:

```
./{Node}/
  {YYYY_ProjectDesc[_I|E][_Researcher][_org]}/
  {YYYYSiteName[_F|C]}/
  {SensorPlatform}/{YYYYMMDD}/run_XX/T1_proc/QC_data/
```

Example:

```
./USYD_Narrabri/2025_SIFCal/2025IAWatson_F/CALVIS/20250825/run_00/T1_proc/QC_data/
```

These vector files (GeoJSON preferred, shapefile accepted) are meant to be
created after the GPRO has been completed. The APPN storage repo has been
updated to include this folder:
<https://github.com/ArdenB/APPN_GenricFileStorage>

---

## Positional QC

> [!WARNING]
> This section is still a work in progress.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Positional QC **must be performed immediately after processing is complete**
> (e.g. straight after GPRO creation). Positional errors are often the first
> indication of a larger problem with the flight or the processing pipeline,
> and almost always require the data to be reprocessed before they can be
> resolved. Catching them early avoids wasted downstream work.

APPN Positional QC is performed in three stages:

1. **[Field Data Collection](#field-data-collection)**
2. **[Observed point capture](#observed-point-capture)**
3. **[Accuracy reporting](#accuracy-reporting)**

> The descriptions below show the procedure for the CALViS using GCPs. The
> process for the GOBI is the same, but there is only the VNIR orthomosaic.
> The same workflow can be used to produce shapefiles if preferred — just
> choose *ESRI Shapefile* in place of *GeoJSON* in the format dropdown.

For the CALViS, in the products folder of the completed GPRO you will find the
`.tif` files:

- `X__VNIR_Orthomosaic.rgb`
- `X_SWIR_Orthomosaic.rgb`

These are the RGB bands from the VNIR and SWIR files respectively. They can be
easier to use than the full `.bin` files, though the procedure is the same.

### Field Data Collection

Independent GCPs are placed in the field during data capture (see
[Standard Flight](../../FlightDesign/StandardFlight) and
[Validation Flight](../../FlightDesign/ValidationFlight)). These GCPs are
independent of any points used during processing so they provide an unbiased
reference ("ground truth") to compare the drone-derived positions against.

The **raw** data exported from the GCP hardware (Aeropoint CSVs, Trimble job
files, etc.) should be saved to the `T0_raw/Vault` folder so the original
measurements are preserved.

   Formal path:

   ```
   ./{Node}/
     {YYYY_ProjectDesc[_I|E][_Researcher][_org]}/
     {YYYYSiteName[_F|C]}/
     {SensorPlatform}/{YYYYMMDD}/run_XX/T0_raw/Vault/
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   ./USYD_Narrabri/2025_SIFCal/2025IAWatson/CALVIS/20250825/run_00/T0_raw/Vault/
   ```

The raw data must then be converted into the APPN standard reference format:
a GeoJSON with one point per GCP and the fields `ID`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`, plus an
explicit CRS. The exact conversion process depends on the GCP hardware
(Aeropoint, Trimble, etc.).

> [!NOTE]
> A step-by-step conversion process for each supported GCP type (Aeropoint,
> Trimble, …) will be added in a future revision. This item is tracked in the
> [future-release backlog](../../../TODO_FUTURE.md). Until then, follow the
> hardware vendor's export workflow and the field-checks listed below.

Common issues to watch for during conversion:

- Mismatched CRS between GCP collection and data processing.
- Incorrect height datum — e.g. GDA2020 ellipsoidal heights vs the Australian
  Height Datum (AHD). See Geoscience Australia's
  [AUSGeoid2020 conversion tool](https://geodesyapps.ga.gov.au/ausgeoid2020)
  for converting between the two.
- Inconsistent `ID` names or duplicate points — fix or remove before saving.

Once the issues are resolved, save the cleaned reference points as
`QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson` in the `T1_proc/QC_data/` folder (see
[Naming Conventions](#naming-conventions) and
[File Storage](#file-storage)).

   Formal path:

   ```
   ./{Node}/
     {YYYY_ProjectDesc[_I|E][_Researcher][_org]}/
     {YYYYSiteName[_F|C]}/
     {SensorPlatform}/{YYYYMMDD}/run_XX/T1_proc/QC_data/QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   ./USYD_Narrabri/2025_SIFCal/2025IAWatson/CALVIS/20250825/run_00/T1_proc/QC_data/QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson
   ```


### Observed point capture

Manually digitise a matched set of points from the drone orthomosaic in QGIS
and save them as `QC_GCP_points.geojson` (see
[Naming Conventions](#naming-conventions)). The `GCP_name` column **must**
match the `ID` values used in `QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson` so that
each observed point can be paired with its reference for accuracy reporting.

#### 1. Load the Data

1. Load the SWIR and VNIR files into QGIS and run the following checks:
   - Do the panels in the SWIR and VNIR overlap?
   - Make note of the CRS.

   ![VNIR at 50% opacity confirming panel overlap with SWIR; information panel showing CRS (EPSG:7855 – GDA2020 / MGA zone 54)](AerialDataQC_media/GCP_swir_vnir.png)

   *Figure: The VNIR is set to 50% opacity to confirm the panels overlap with the
SWIR. The information panel is open on the SWIR to confirm the CRS (EPSG:7855
– GDA2020 / MGA zone 54). This CRS is for Roseworthy SA where this CALViS
flight was collected.*

> [!CAUTION]
> For CALViS, the SWIR and VNIR orthomosaics **must** be checked
> independently. The two sensors are georeferenced separately, and we have
> seen flights where the GNSS correction was applied cleanly to one
> orthomosaic but was broken or offset in the other. Confirming each one
> on its own is the only reliable way to catch this.

Instead of transparency you can also toggle one image on and off to confirm
the overlap is acceptable.

If overlap is fine:

 2. Load the ground-truth GPS data (`QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson`) for
    your GCPs. The reference layer is loaded first so it is easy to name the
    digitised points on the drone imagery to match.

   ![GCPs_groundtruth_overlay](AerialDataQC_media/GCP_img1.png)

Example of the ground-truth points over a GCP visible in the CALViS
orthomosaic:

![GCPs_groundtruth_overlay_zoom](AerialDataQC_media/GCP_img2.png)

#### 2. Create the Vector Layer

1. Navigate to **Layer → Create Layer → New Shapefile Layer**.

   Set the **File Name** to `QC_GCP_points`, the **Geometry type**
   to *Point*, and replace the pre-filled `id` field with `GCP_name` of type
   **Text (string)**.

   ![GCPs_set_up_shapefile](AerialDataQC_media/GCP_img3.png)

2. Set the **File Name** to `QC_GCP_points.shp` (it will be exported
   to GeoJSON in step 5).
3. Set the **Geometry type** to *Point*.
4. Set the **CRS** to match the orthomosaic.
5. Add a single field — `GCP_name`:
   - Select the pre-filled `id` field in the Fields list and click
     **Remove Field** (bottom right) to remove it.
   - Add `GCP_name` as **Text (string)**.

#### 3. Annotating the GCPs

To start annotating the drone orthomosaic:

1. Select `QC_GCP_points` in the **Layers** menu.
2. Click the pencil icon (**Toggle Editing**).
3. Click **Add Point Feature**.

![GCPs_editlayer](AerialDataQC_media/GCP_img4.png)

4. Navigate to the centre of each GCP, left-click to drop a point, and enter
   the `GCP_name` so it matches the corresponding `ID` in
   `QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson`. In the figure below the ground-truth
   point is green and the digitised (observed) point is red — the offset
   between them is the positional error being measured.

![GCPs_point_eg](AerialDataQC_media/GCP_img5.png)

Repeat for every GCP visible in the orthomosaic.

#### 5. Save the data as a GeoJSON

1. Right-click `QC_GCP_points` in the **Layers** menu →
   **Export → Save Features As…**.

2. Set **Format** to *GeoJSON*, confirm the **File Name** and target folder
   (click the three dots to navigate), and double-check the **CRS** matches
   the orthomosaic.

![GCPs_export_json](AerialDataQC_media/GCP_img6.png)

### Accuracy reporting

Run the QA code at
<https://github.com/ArdenB/APPN_GenricFileStorage>
(`Code/DS02_DatasetQA/`) to generate a spatial accuracy report comparing the
observed (drone) and reference (surveyed) GCP locations. The report produces
per-point residuals and overall RMSE in X, Y, and Z.

The code pairs each observed point in `QC_GCP_points.geojson` with the
matching reference point in `QC_GCP_groundtruth_points.geojson` using the
`GCP_name` / `ID` fields (see [Naming Conventions](#naming-conventions)), so
those identifiers **must** match exactly for a point to appear in the report.

**What the report contains**

- **Per-point residuals** — the signed difference between the observed and
  reference position for every paired GCP, in metres, broken out as
  `dX`, `dY`, and `dZ` (easting, northing, and height) plus the horizontal
  (`dXY = sqrt(dX² + dY²)`) and total 3D offset. These identify whether an
  error is uniform across the site (suggesting a systematic shift or datum
  problem) or localised to individual points (suggesting a digitising or
  ground-truth error).
- **Summary statistics** — overall **RMSE** in X, Y, and Z, the horizontal
  and 3D RMSE, and the mean (bias) and standard deviation of the residuals.
  A large mean relative to the standard deviation indicates a systematic
  offset; a large standard deviation indicates noisy or inconsistent
  georeferencing.
- **Point count** — the number of GCPs successfully paired. If this is lower
  than the number of GCPs placed in the field, check for unmatched
  `GCP_name` / `ID` values before interpreting the result.

**How to interpret the result**

1. Check the **point count** first — a report built from only one or two
   paired GCPs is not a reliable accuracy estimate.
2. Inspect the **mean residual (bias)**. A consistent non-zero bias in X, Y,
   or Z across all points usually points to a CRS / height-datum mismatch
   (see the common issues under [Field Data Collection](#field-data-collection))
   rather than a true positional error, and can often be corrected without
   reprocessing.
3. Inspect **individual large residuals**. A single GCP with a much larger
   offset than the rest is most often a mis-digitised observed point or a
   bad ground-truth measurement — re-check that point before concluding the
   flight has failed.
4. Compare the **RMSE** against the acceptance thresholds below.

**Where to save the report**

Save the generated report alongside the input vector layers in the
`T1_proc/QC_data/` folder (see [File Storage](#file-storage)) so the residuals
travel with the dataset.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pass / fail thresholds.** Flag a flight for **caution** when the RMSE
> exceeds **5 cm**, and treat it as a **fail** when the RMSE exceeds
> **10 cm**. Record the reported values in the QC log and review any flight
> that breaches the caution threshold. These limits will be evaluated further
> during the APEx flights to confirm they are appropriate.

## Spectral QC

Spectral QC is done by drawing polygons in GIS software over surfaces with
known spectral values, then extracting and comparing them. This is done after
all processing in software like GPT is complete.

CALViS and GOBI flights conducted prior to the *Operational Excellence in APPN
Hyperspectral Imaging* SIF likely consist of one GRYFN reflectance panel
(used to generate the ELM in the GRYFN Processing Tool) along with additional
panels for validation.### Extracting Pixels into a Table

File naming, format (GeoJSON preferred), and storage location for the
polygons created below all follow the
[General QC Conventions](#general-qc-conventions) above.

### Creating Geospatial Vector Data — GOBI & CALViS (QGIS)

> The description below shows the procedure for creating GeoJSON files for the
>  CALViS using GRYFN reflectance panels for ELM. The process for the GOBI is
>  the same, but there is only the VNIR orthomosaic. The same workflow can be
>  used to produce shapefiles if preferred — just choose *ESRI Shapefile* in
>  place of *GeoJSON* in the format dropdown.

For the CALViS, in the products folder of the completed GPRO you will find the
`.tif` files:

- `X__VNIR_Orthomosaic.rgb`
- `X_calvis_sif_cal_20250925_SWIR_Orthomosaic.rgb`

These are the RGB bands from the VNIR and SWIR files respectively. They can be
easier to use than the full `.bin` files, though the procedure is the same.

#### 1. Load the Data

1. Load both files into QGIS and run the following checks:
   - Do the panels in the SWIR and VNIR overlap?
   - Make note of the CRS.

![VNIR at 50% opacity confirming panel overlap with SWIR; information panel showing CRS (EPSG:7855 – GDA2020 / MGA zone 55)](AerialDataQC_media/image_e633a4a22300.png)

*Figure: The VNIR is set to 50% opacity to confirm the panels overlap with the
SWIR. The information panel is open on the SWIR to confirm the CRS (EPSG:7855
– GDA2020 / MGA zone 55). This CRS is for Narrabri NSW where this CALViS
flight was collected.*

#### 2. Create the Vector Layer

> [!NOTE]
> This section is pending review and expansion (panel-specific guidance) by
> Richard Harwood, tracked in the
> [future-release backlog](../../../TODO_FUTURE.md).


1. Navigate to **Layer → Create Layer → New GeoPackage Layer…** for GeoJSON
   output, or **New Shapefile Layer…** if producing a shapefile. Either way
   you will set the output **File Name** with the appropriate extension
   (`.geojson` preferred, `.shp` accepted).

   ![New Shapefile Layer dialog](AerialDataQC_media/image_9f6183a618a4.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > To save directly as GeoJSON you can also create a temporary scratch
   > layer and then **Export → Save Features As… → GeoJSON** in step 5.

2. Set the **File Name** to `QC_ELM_Panels.geojson` (see the
   [naming conventions](#naming-conventions) table for the correct name given
   your use case).
3. Set the **Geometry type** to *Polygon*.
4. Set the **CRS** to match your dataset.
5. Add a single field — `Panel_ref`:
   - Select the pre-filled `id` field in the Fields list and click
     **Remove Field** (bottom right) to remove it.
   - Set `Panel_ref` as an **Integer** between 0–100. It is the percentage
     reflectance (e.g. 11, 30, 56, 82 for GRYFN panels).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You need to click **Add to Fields List** once you populate "New Field".

   ![Shapefile field configuration](AerialDataQC_media/image_a66d67f857b2.png)

#### 3. Draw Boxes over the Panels

The boxes should be polygons drawn inside the panel. The points should be
drawn to cover as much of the panel as possible without including edge effects
(2–3 pixels from the edge of the panel). If there are gaps or missing values
within the panel, they should be included.

1. Select `QC_ELM_Panels` in the **Layers** menu.
2. Click the pencil icon (**Toggle Editing**).

   ![Toggle Editing](AerialDataQC_media/image_d8834d7ee07a.png)

3. Click **Add Polygon Feature**
   ![Add Polygon Feature icon](AerialDataQC_media/image_2e3764a4b5f4.png).
4. Click four points around a specific reflectance panel, then right-click to
   close the polygon. Repeat for all panels (e.g. 11, 30, 56, 82).

   ![Polygon drawn over reflectance panel](AerialDataQC_media/image_a14d736973fa.png)

#### 4. Sanity Check Labels

1. Double-click `QC_ELM_Panels` in the **Layers** menu.
2. In **Layer Properties**, click **Labels** and select **Single Labels**.

   ![Label configuration](AerialDataQC_media/image_2ee37c5d6f35.png)

#### 5. Save the File

1. Right-click `QC_ELM_Panels` in the **Layers** menu → **Export → Save
   Features As**.

   ![Export menu](AerialDataQC_media/image_897abfd23192.png)

2. Set the **Format** to *GeoJSON* (preferred) — or *ESRI Shapefile* if
   required. Make sure the **File Name** is correct and in the right folder
   (click the three dots to navigate). Double-check the **CRS**.

   ![Save dialog](AerialDataQC_media/image_a77a81d079ab.png)



Arden Burrell has made a Python script that can go through the APPN standard
folder structure, extract the values into a table, and save that as a `.csv`
or `.parquet` file automatically. The code is available from:

<https://github.com/ArdenB/APPN_GenricFileStorage>

- **Script:** `Code/DS02_DatasetQA/QA00_ELMvaliditation.py`
- **README:** `Code/DS02_DatasetQA/README.md`

If nodes choose to extract the points using other means, the tables should
have the following columns:

```
band, wavelength, value, Panel_ref, node, project, site, sensor, date, run, panel_name, type, gpro_nu
```

### Accuracy reporting

> [!NOTE]
> A spectral accuracy-reporting procedure is planned but not yet defined.
> Developing an acceptable spectral accuracy baseline requires data from the
> APEx flights; once that data is available, this section will document how
> the extracted panel reflectances are compared against their known values
> and the pass/fail criteria that result. This item is tracked in the
> [future-release backlog](../../../TODO_FUTURE.md).

## LiDAR QC

> [!WARNING]
> This section is still a work in progress.

> [!NOTE]
> Both the LiDAR **sampling** and **accuracy-reporting** procedures are
