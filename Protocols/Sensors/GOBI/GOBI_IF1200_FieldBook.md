# APPN – GOBI IF1200 Fieldbook

For a high-level description of the GOBI sensor package and how it sits
alongside the other APPN platforms, see the
[Platforms Overview](../../Background/PlatformsOverview/Platforms_Overview.md).

For the GOBI fieldbook covering the DJI M350, see
[GOBI M350 Fieldbook](../GOBI/GOBI_M350_FieldBook.md).

This fieldbook provides a standardised operational guide for APPN GOBI UAV
deployments **on the Inspired Flight IF1200A**, supporting safe flight
operations, consistent sensor configuration, and high-integrity data
capture. It is intended for trained APPN staff conducting hyperspectral,
LiDAR, RGB, and GNSS-INS data acquisitions, and promotes repeatability,
transparency, and confidence in downstream data analysis across APPN
operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This protocol must be followed for all standard APPN GOBI IF1200 UAV
> flights.** Adherence to these procedures is essential to ensure operational
> safety, data integrity, and comparability of datasets across deployments.
> For any flights that **fall outside standard operating procedures**,
> detailed records must be kept documenting all deviations, including the
> specific settings changed, the rationale for those changes, and any
> anticipated implications for data quality or analysis.

## Flight Planning – Inspired Flight IF1200A

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that you apply for UAV flight approvals for locations and dates of
> flights well in advance.

1. Using a GPS survey system (Emlid, Trimble…) or a GIS software, create a
   polygon of the area of interest. Make sure your polygon includes the areas
   where you will place your calibration panels and GCPs, with an additional
   5 m buffer to avoid incomplete data.
2. Save this polygon twice as a KML — once as a *survey* polygon and once as a
   *capture* polygon.
3. If using QGIS, export the polygon as a KML (in Geometry, select *include
   z-dimension*, and ensure the CRS is set to WGS 84). Import the *capture*
   KML into the [HPI Polygon Tool](http://50.170.92.179/) and export. This
   polygon sets the activation of the hyperspectral sensor within Hyperspec3.
4. Import the *survey* polygon into QGroundControl.
5. Using both QGroundControl and the GRYFN flight calculator, determine the
   speed, altitude, and frame period required to survey the area of interest.
   See the [Standard Mission Parameters](#standard-mission-parameters) table
   below for examples of common flight types.
   - Do not go below 2 m/s or above 8 m/s for stability reasons (GRYFN).
     Speeds greater than 8 m/s lead to excessive aircraft pitch and speeds
     less than 2 m/s accentuate the impacts of wind on aircraft stability and
     cause a visibly less smooth trajectory.
   - Altitude and speed will be tested and recommended from APEx results.
   - Ensure the frame period is at a minimum of 20% oversampling, the side
     overlap is > 40% for the SWIR sensor, and the *turnaround distance* is
     2× flight speed (> 3× at > 6 m/s).
6. Ensure flight lines are in the direction of planting (GRYFN).

## Pre-Flight

1. Conduct airspace and weather checks.
   - No cloud cover.
   - Maximum wind speed for quality hyperspectral capture is **6 m/s
     (~22 km/h)**. Any wind speed over **5 m/s (~18 km/h)** should be
     recorded.
   - Do not operate in conditions below 0 °C or above 40 °C.
   - Try to ensure the sun is within ±20° of solar noon (approximately
     2 hours before or after noon). **However**, *this depends on time of
     year and latitude — check
     [NOAA solar calculator](https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/) if
     unsure.*
2. Turn on the aeronautical radio and set to local CTAF (find in
   [ERSA](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/aip/aip.asp)).
3. *(Optional)* Set up the Emlid RTK (install a peg or permanent GCP below
   the base station for recurring flights), let it run for at least
   15 minutes, and start recording the RINEX file before flying.
4. Set up reflectance panels, the validation panel, and GCPs following the
   [Standard Flight Procedure](../../FlightDesign/StandardFlight/Standard_Flight.md).
   In summary:

   - Use the [Dual ELM panel flight](../../FlightDesign/StandardFlight/Standard_Flight.md#dual-elm-panel-flight)
     layout by default (mandatory for missions > 15 minutes — noting that
     IF1200 missions are typically < 30 minutes, so a calibration panel is
     overflown approximately every 15 minutes).
   - Fall back to the [Single ELM panel flight](../../FlightDesign/StandardFlight/Standard_Flight.md#single-elm-panel-flight)
     layout only when a second panel set is unavailable.
   - Deploy the 2-panel validation set with its paired elevated + ground
     GCPs per [Validation Panel Setup](../../FlightDesign/StandardFlight/Standard_Flight.md#validation-panel-setup).
   - Follow the [Panel Setup](../../FlightDesign/StandardFlight/Standard_Flight.md#panel-setup)
     rules (level folding table, panels in brightness order aligned with
     the flight direction, record panel-surface height).
   - Place 5 GCPs per [Ground Control Points](../../FlightDesign/StandardFlight/Standard_Flight.md#ground-control-points)
     — in alternate flight lines, next to the calibration panels.
   - When flying multiple missions, panels and GCPs must be present in
     every flight (panels overflown approximately every 15 minutes).

6. Set up the landing pad and UAV in a safe RTH location.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In dusty environments, an additional tarp must be used under the
> landing pad.

7. On the controller, set up a safe UAV RTH location, RTH altitude, and
   other geo-fencing settings on the IF1200.
8. Attach payload to the aircraft:

> [!CAUTION]
> The IF1200 dovetail has no hot-swap protection, so ensure the IF1200
> is powered off when attaching or removing the sensor
> ([more details](https://gryfn.gitbook.io/gryfn-hardware/headwall-co-aligned-hp/user-manual/integration)).

   - Check that all lenses and sensors are clean. If not, use professional
     lens cleaning wipes (e.g.
     [Zeiss Lens Wipes](https://eyesolutions.com.au/products/zeiss-lens-wipes),
     recommended by GRYFN) to clean them.
   - Connect the power cable from aircraft to payload (non-standard payload
     bus only).
   - Connect both GNSS antenna cables to the correct ports (match A1 and
     A2).
   - Remove RGB and Nano HP lens caps.
   - Insert RGB SD card.
9. Power on the radio controller; check battery status.
10. Launch QGroundControl on the IF1200 controller.
11. Review the flight plan, checking operational height and double-checking
    that area of interest, GCPs, and reflectance panels are all within the
    capture polygon.
12. Power on the aircraft; confirm connection to GCS and battery status;
    ensure Remote ID is enabled.
13. The IF1200 does not use RTK; ensure a minimum of 8 satellites and GPS
    lock before flying.
14. Upload the flight plan to the aircraft.

## GOBI Sensor Configuration

1. Place the 80% exposure reference panel under the Nano HP lens; avoid
   casting shadows.
   - Place the drone legs upon exposure-angle cones, ensuring a fixed
     angle is achieved each exposure setting.
     **(angle provided through SIF excellence)**
   - The maximum distance from the VNIR HS sensor to the GOBI reflectance
     panel is 40 cm. This is calculated based on the FOV and a 20 cm panel
     size.
2. Connect to GOBI Wi-Fi or connect the ethernet cable to the payload.
   *If using ethernet, ensure a static IP address for the sensor at*
   `10.0.65.2` (or anything other than `50`, `100`, and `128`, and must be
   less than `255`).
3. Navigate to the GOBI WebUI at `10.0.65.50`.
4. Ensure a valid altitude is shown in the top-right corner of the WebUI
   (~10–20 m error is acceptable). Typically, this will normalise to
   ground elevation within 4–6 minutes.
5. Name the mission, using the convention `YYYYMMDD_XXXX`
   (`YYYY` = year; `MM` = month; `DD` = day, must be 2 digits;
   `XXXX` = a short reference or abbreviation for the job).
6. Ensure the correct UAV (IF1200) is selected in the dropdown box.
   **This is very important.**

> [!CAUTION]
> Selecting the incorrect drone will render all data captured unrecoverable

7. Scroll down to polygon settings. Ensure triggering is set by
   **Polygon** in the dropdown menu. Set min and, optionally, max altitude
   triggers (recommended to set a minimum of at least 20 m to prevent
   unnecessary data capture).
8. Import the polygon KML or select from previously flown missions using
   the dropdown menu. Inspect the map to ensure it aligns with
   expectations.
9. Return to the top of the WebUI, open the Flight Calculator, and update
   flying height / flight speed; adjust the oversampling buffer (must be
   at least 20%, recommended setting is 30%).
   **(value may change through hyperspectral excellence)** Frame period
   will be automatically updated.
10. Adjust exposure until ~95% spectral saturation at the **peak of the
    90th percentile line** without exceeding the frame period. Use the
    lowest gain mode that still provides sufficient saturation.
    **(value may change through hyperspectral excellence)**
11. Place the lens cap on the Nano HP.
12. Click **Collect Dark Reference**; wait to finish.
13. **Remove the lens cap.**
14. Remove the exposure reference panel and return it to its case.
15. Press **Start Mission**.
16. Remove the ethernet cable (if using) and begin flight operations.

---

## Flight Operations

1. Ensure the aircraft is in **Position** flight mode.
2. Sync / verify the flight plan in QGroundControl; double-check the flight
   plan.
3. Clear people/objects away from the UAV.
4. Notify crew/observers that takeoff is beginning.
5. Begin manual takeoff, check stick controls work, and then fly to ~12 m
   AGL; **do not exceed** the trigger altitude (20 m default) before
   mission start.
6. Perform dynamic alignment (one to two figure-8 patterns) at a
   recommended speed of **5 m/s**, at a lower height than capture height
   and outside of the capture polygon area.
7. Enable autonomous mission.
8. Monitor UAV battery voltage/percentage in flight.
9. After mission, switch back to **Position** mode to regain manual
   control.
10. Lower to capture altitude and perform post-mission dynamic alignment
    (figure-8).
11. Land and disarm UAV.
12. Leave the UAV, transmitter, and sensor powered on; begin post-flight
    checks. Ensure data transfer is finished before turning off the sensor.
13. **Do not hot-swap the batteries.** Treat each flight as a new flight.

---

## Post-Flight Sensor Configuration

1. Reconnect to GOBI Wi-Fi or ethernet cable.
2. Open a browser to `10.0.65.50` or refresh the UI.
3. Press **Stop Mission**.
4. Replace the Nano HP and RGB lens caps.
5. In the WebUI, ensure all data has captured correctly (see the
   [Data Confirmation](#data-confirmation) table below).

---

## Post-Flight

1. Power off the aircraft, then the controller. Inspect the aircraft for
   any damage and report for maintenance if necessary.
2. Disconnect the ethernet cable from the payload, if using.
3. Disconnect the aircraft batteries.
4. Disconnect the payload power cable.
5. Disconnect the payload GNSS cables.
6. Undo the mounting clamp, remove the payload, and place it in its case.
7. Pack up the aircraft and all gear from site, double-checking against
   the checklist at the start of this document to ensure everything is
   accounted for.

---

## Offload Data

1. Open WinSCP, FileZilla, or similar FTP software.
2. Connect to the GRYFN Gobi via `gryfn@10.0.65.50` (password: `gryfn`).
3. Raw GNSS & LiDAR PCAP location: `/data/{mission name}`.
4. VNIR data location: `/data/capturedData/captured/{dateTime}`.
5. GOBI logs location: `/data/gryfn.log.{date}`.
6. RGB images are stored on the camera SD card.
7. Download GNSS, LiDAR, logs, and RGB after each mission; download
   hyperspectral data later due to its size.
8. Clear data directories after download and backup to avoid filling the
   500 GB SSD.
